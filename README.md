JS Barcodes
===========

My JS library for producing barcodes. This project was thrown together as a
tool to print on sticker paper that I purchased at my local office supplies
store. There's not much more than that here for now.

Glyphicons
----------

Glyphicons is available at [https://www.glyphicons.com](https://www.glyphicons.com),
if you want to use them. Currently I do not have a solution to remove and add them
automatically. Any element with tag `data-glyphicons` indicates what glyphicon SVG
should be in its place.
